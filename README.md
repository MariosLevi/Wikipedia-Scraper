# bs4Scraper
Scraper written with Beautiful Soup, the example provided is going through wikipedia's unusual articles https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Unusual_articles
The contents of that ^link then get parsed into a .csv (that gets saved into your User folder)
Note that this is my first real web-scraper, so the output file has a lot of problems due to special characted found on the page (2000 entries).

Note you will need to install BeautifulSoup / bs4 / urllib
